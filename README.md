This repository is my practice work based on 
the instructions from the YouTube video 
[Python Django Tutorial for Beginners](https://youtu.be/rHux0gMZ3Eg?si=nLOUg8gMsjWm2-2j).


# Create the Virtual Environment
Iâ€™m using Python version 3.12.1 on a Windows system. 
The required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

To create the environment, execute the following command:
```
py -m venv env
```

Afterward, activate the environment with:
```
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

Then, install the required packages into the environment with:
```
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```
